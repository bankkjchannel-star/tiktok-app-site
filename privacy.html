    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <b>APP_NAME</b> ("App") handles information. We aim to collect the minimum
      necessary to provide the service.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Information we handle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>TikTok OAuth data:</b> authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, and basic account identifiers returned by TikTok.</li>
      <li><b>User content metadata:</b> caption text, posting options you enter in the App.</li>
      <li><b>Local media files:</b> videos you select from your computer (handled for upload; not needed for this website).</li>
      <li><b>Diagnostics (optional):</b> basic logs to help troubleshoot errors (e.g., API responses, timestamps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Where data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the App stores tokens/config <b>locally on your computer</b>. This template assumes the App
      does not run a remote backend and does not store your tokens on our servers.
      If you later add a backend, update this policy accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To authenticate you with TikTok and perform actions you request (upload/post).</li>
      <li>To show status, errors, and logs inside the App.</li>
      <li>To maintain basic functionality like saving your settings/queue locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We share data only with TikTok as needed to execute your requests via their APIs,
      and only based on your authorization.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Tokens and settings remain on your device until you delete them, uninstall the App, or revoke access in your TikTok settings.
      Logs (if any) are stored locally and can be cleared by you.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data handled by the App. However, no system is 100% secure.
      You are responsible for securing your device and environment.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can stop using the App at any time.</li>
      <li>You can revoke TikTok access from your TikTok account settings.</li>
      <li>You can delete local App data (tokens/config/logs) from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions or requests: <b>CONTACT_EMAIL</b></p>
